# HockeyPinball


To start the game, just run HockeyPinball.exe.

The game's C# scripts are located in Assets/Scripts.

CONTROLS:
Z - Left Paddle
/ - Right Paddle
SPACE - Launch Spring
ESCAPE - Quit Application

Note: This is still in a prototype phase and there are many features missing.(Like a pause screen). Also the highscore database will not work if your machine is 64-bit. This is a .dll issue that will be fixed.

Another Note: When looking in the scripts, you may notice many public class members even when it seems unnecessary. This IS necessary due to how Unity utilizes public variables to edit them in Unity's Editor.
